# React Context & Hooks 
## Introduction 
#### Context API

Provide clean and easy way to share state between components. 

#### Hooks 

Tap into the inner workings of react functional components 

### What is the Context API

The context API gives us a way to share state up and down a component tree quite easily. Giving us a central place to store data or State and then share it between components, without having to pass it down as props.

You can do the same using props, but it can get a little bit messy especially as your component trees an application becomes bigger.

## Adding a context & provider

## Accessing Context

Once the context provider is wrapping the components, there's a couple different ways we can do this. 

### Context Type

This way **can be used in a class component but not in functional components**. The way we use this is by:

	import React, { Component } from "react";
	import { ThemeContext } from "../contexts/ThemeContext";
	
	class Navbar extends Component {
	  static contextType = ThemeContext;
	  render() {
	  ...

Doing this procedure <code>this.context</code>will be set at run time to the current value of the given Context. In this case the

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
